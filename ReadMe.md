# My CV

State: I used the Word version instead.
(The data here is up to data as of now, Dec 2022. But there is no layout as you can see. For that, see the Word version (which is.. on website. soon. maybe)).


## Compilation

With TinyTex, like [here](https://github.com/tfiers/phd-thesis); 
but with XeLaTeX (for Unicode & modern fonts),
and with these packages additionally installed:
```
$ tlmgr.bat install --with-doc [none yet]
```

See [`Justfile`](Justfile) for the build command, which you can run
manually, or, after installing [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)
(e.g. via Chocolatey on Windows), by running
```
$ just
```
in this directory.
