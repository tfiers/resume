## Compilation

With TinyTex, like [here](https://github.com/tfiers/phd-thesis); 
but with XeLaTeX (for Unicode & modern fonts),
and with these packages additionally installed:
```
$ tlmgr.bat install --with-doc [none yet]
```

See [`Justfile`](Justfile) for the build command, which you can run
manually, or, after installing [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)
(e.g. via Chocolatey on Windows), by running
```
$ just
```
in this directory.
