# My CV

## Compilation

With TinyTex, like [here](https://github.com/tfiers/phd-thesis)\
but with XeLaTeX (for Unicode & modern fonts)
```
latexmk -pdf -xelatex -pvc resume.tex
```
(`pvc` = preview, continuously build)

..and with these packages additionally installed
```
tlmgr.bat install --with-doc [none yet]
```
